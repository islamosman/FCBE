5.	Payment Terms

5.1     Payment Method & Payments

You may be required to provide Rabbit with a valid credit card, debit card, or other payment account (“Payment Method”) in order to use certain Services, including Rental Services provided by Rabbit or a Platform Partner. When you add a Payment Method to your Rabbit account, you will be asked to provide customary billing information. You must provide accurate, current, and complete information when adding a Payment Method and it is your obligation to keep your Payment Method up-to-date at all times.

You represent and warrant to Rabbit that you are authorized to use any Payment Method you furnish to Rabbit. You authorize Rabbit to charge the Payment Method for all fees incurred by you with respect to Rental Services (or other services offered by Rabbit or Platform Partners from time to time), including applicable sales, use, VAT and other local government charges. If you dispute any charge on your account, you must contact Rabbit within 10 business days from the end of the month within which the disputed charge occurred, and provide to Rabbit all trip information that is necessary to identify the disputed charge, such as the date of the trip and the approximate starting and ending times of the ride associated with the disputed charge. You agree to immediately inform Rabbit of all changes relating to the Payment Method.

5.2     Auto-Update

Rabbit or its Platform Partner may require or make available an option for you to preload a balance associated with your account and automatically make payments on a recurring basis (“Auto-Update”). By enabling Auto-Update, you opt to automatically reload your account balance each time your account reaches or falls below zero or another specified amount. Rabbit or its affiliates or Platform Partners may, at any time, without any notice to you, discontinue Auto-Update.

To use Auto-Update, you may be required to choose: (a) the balance amount at which you wish to automatically load your account balance, and/or (b) the amount you wish to load/add (such amount, “Auto-Update Amount”).

If your account is eligible for a bonus for your Auto-Update selection (“Auto-Update Bonus”), your Auto-Update Bonus will be charged first for using the applicable Rental Services. Auto-Update Bonus amounts may only be used for Rental Services, and Auto-Update Bonus amounts are not recoverable if your account is closed for any reason.

We reserve the right to decide the Payment Methods eligible for Auto-Update. You may change your Payment Method for Auto-Update at any time, provided such Payment Method is eligible for Auto-Update.

You may only use the Auto-Update balance in the currency in which your Payment Method was charged. In case you make use of Rental Services that are charged in a currency different than the one in your Auto-Update balance, Rabbit may charge your Payment Method directly.

You may cancel or disable Auto Update in the settings/preferences of your account on the Rabbit application. In the event: (a) you cancel or disable Auto-Update of your Rabbit account balance; or (b) one of your automatic payments is declined, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, expiry of your card: the Auto-Update Amount will not be added to your account balance. In such scenarios, you may be required to separately load your account balance.

We may choose to notify you, through email or SMS, once your account balance reaches or falls below zero. You authorize us to communicate with you through emails or SMS in connection with Auto-Update. You acknowledge that we may also communicate with you through any of our affiliate(s).

5.3     Payment Facilitators

You agree, understand and acknowledge that Rabbit may engage third party payment processors / gateway service providers to facilitate processing of payments, including Auto-Update. Accordingly, you may be required to follow any terms and conditions of such third party payment processors/gateway service providers, as communicated to you, from time to time.


6.	Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

6.1    Initial Dispute Resolution

The Rabbit application contains means to receive support and address any concerns you may have regarding your use of Rental Services. The parties shall use their best efforts through this support process to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating mediation, arbitration, or a lawsuit.

6.2   Binding Arbitration

If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution through the support process, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, and the parties’ relationship with each other shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by a mutually agreed upon arbitrator or arbitration service.

The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Rabbit will pay the additional cost. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

•	Location

The arbitration will take place in Cairo, Egypt or a mutually agreed upon location.

•	Class Action Waiver.

The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND RABBIT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

•	Litigation of Intellectual Property and Courts of First Instance Claims.

Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.

•	Right to Opt Out.

You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Scooters Rabbit, LLC., 410 West Golf, New Cairo, Cairo, Egypt. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of Services, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Rabbit also will not be bound by them.

•	Changes to this Section.

Rabbit will provide prior written notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective only after prior written notice and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the notice period.

7.	Solicited Submission Policy.  Where Rabbit has specifically invited or requested submissions or comments, Rabbit encourages you to submit content to Rabbit that you have created for consideration in connection with such requests (“User Submissions”).  User Submissions remains the intellectual property of the individual user. By submitting content to Rabbit, you expressly grant Rabbit a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up worldwide, fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, perform and display such content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Submission, in whole or in part, and in any form throughout the world in any media or technology, whether now known or hereafter discovered, including all promotion, advertising, marketing, merchandising, publicity and any other ancillary uses thereof, and including the unfettered right to sublicense such rights, in perpetuity throughout the universe. Any such User Submissions are deemed non-confidential and Rabbit shall be under no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any information, in whatever form, contained in any User Submission.

8.	Inappropriate User Submissions.  Rabbit does not encourage, and does not seek User Submissions that result from any activity that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; or (iii) may constitute a crime or tort.  You agree that you have not and will not engage in any of the foregoing activities in connection with producing your User Submission. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that in conjunction with your submission, you will not inflict emotional distress on other people, will not humiliate other people (publicly or otherwise), will not assault or threaten other people, will not enter onto private property without permission, will not impersonate any other person or misrepresent your affiliation, title, or authority, and will not otherwise engage in any activity that may result in injury, death, property damage, and/or liability of any kind. Rabbit will reject any User Submissions in which Rabbit believes, in its sole discretion, that any such activities have occurred.  If notified by a user of a submission that allegedly violates any provision of these Terms of Use, Rabbit reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, if such a violation has occurred, and to remove any such submission from the Services at any time and without notice.

9.	Inappropriate Material. You are prohibited from using the Services to post or send any unlawful, infringing, threatening, defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic or profane material or any material that infringes or misappropriates third party intellectual property or could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or otherwise violate any law. You further agree that sending or posting unsolicited advertisements or “spam” on or through the Services is expressly prohibited by this Agreement.  In addition to any remedies that we may have at law or in equity, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated or are likely to violate the foregoing prohibitions or any applicable rules or policies linked to in these Terms of Service, we may take any action we deem necessary to cure or prevent the violation, including without limitation, banning you from using the Services and/or the immediate removal of the related materials from the Services at any time without notice. We will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order or subpoena requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone posting such materials.

10.	Access and Interference. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Services for any purpose without our express written permission. Additionally, you agree that you will not: (i) take any action that imposes, or may impose in our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (ii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the site or any activities conducted on the Services; or (iii) bypass any measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Services.

11.	Right to Takedown Content.  Except as disclosed in our Privacy Policy, we will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a user’s e-mail or content posted to the Services unless required in the course of normal maintenance of the Services and its systems or unless required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Rabbit or the Services; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Rabbit, the Services, or the users of the Services; or (3) act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our users, the Services, or the public. Users shall remain solely responsible for the content of their messages and Rabbit shall have no obligation to prescreen any such content. However, we shall have the right in our sole discretion to edit, refuse to post or remove any material submitted to or posted on the Services at any time without notice. Without limiting the foregoing, we shall have the right to remove any material that we find to be in violation of the provisions hereof or otherwise objectionable, and the additional right to deny any user who fails to conform to any provision of these Terms of Service access to the Services or any part thereof.

12.	User Published Content. User published Content and User Submissions do not represent the views of Rabbit or any individual associated with Rabbit, and we do not control this Content.  In no event shall you represent or suggest, directly or indirectly, Rabbit’s endorsement of user published Content. Rabbit does not vouch for the accuracy or credibility of any user published Content on our Services or User Submissions published through our Services, and do not take any responsibility or assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of reviewing any such user published Content or User Submission.

13.	Third Party Links. From time to time, the Services may contain links to websites that are not owned, operated or controlled by Rabbit or its affiliates. All such links are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the Services. Rabbit is not responsible for any content, materials or other information located on or accessible from any other website. Neither we nor any of our respective affiliates endorse, guarantee, or make any representations or warranties regarding any other websites, or any content, materials or other information located or accessible from any other websites, or the results that you may obtain from using any other websites. If you decide to access any other websites linked to or from this Services, you do so entirely at your own risk.

14.	Transactional Partners.  In some cases we may partner with another entity to co-promote their services within our Services.  In these cases, you may be transacting directly with the other party. On those pages or locations, the transactional partners’ brand is clearly visible and their terms of service are posted.  When using these partner pages, you are bound by partner terms of service in addition to remaining bound by these Rabbit Terms of Service.  When there is a conflict between these Terms of Service and the partner’s terms of service with respect to any dispute relating to Rabbit or the Rabbit Services, these Terms of Service will prevail.

Furthermore, You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them.

24.	DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (“DMCA”) NOTICE. In operating the Services, we may act as a “services provider” (as defined by DMCA) and offer services as online provider of materials and links to third party websites. As a result, third party materials that we do not own or control may be transmitted, stored, accessed or otherwise made available using the Services. Rabbit has in place certain legally mandated procedures regarding allegations of copyright infringement occurring on the Services. Rabbit has adopted a policy that provides for the removal of any content or the potential suspension of any user that is found to have repeatedly infringed on the rights of Rabbit or of a third party, or that has otherwise violated any intellectual property laws or regulations, or any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you believe any material available via the Services infringes a copyright, you should notify us using the notice procedure for claimed infringement under the DMCA (17 U.S.C. Sect. 512(c)(2)). We will respond expeditiously to remove or disable access to the material claimed to be infringing and will follow the procedures specified in the DMCA to resolve the claim between the notifying party and the alleged infringer who provided the Content. Our designated agent (i.e., proper party for notice) to whom you should address infringement notices under the DMCA is support@rabbit-app.com

Please provide the following notice:
•	Identify the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
•	Identify the material on the Services that you claim is infringing, with enough detail so that we may locate it on the Services;
•	A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
•	A statement by you declaring under penalty of perjury that (a) the above information in your notice is accurate, and (b) that you are the owner of the copyright interest involved or that you are authorized to act on behalf of that owner;
•	Your address, telephone number, and email address; and
•	Your physical or electronic signature.

We may give notice to our users of any infringement notice by means of a general notice on any of our Services, electronic mail to a user’s email address in our records, or by written communication sent by first-class mail to a user’s physical address in our records. If you receive such an infringement notice, you may provide counter-notification in writing to the designated agent that includes the information below. To be effective, the counter-notification must be a written communication that includes the following:
•	Your physical or electronic signature;
•	Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
•	A statement from you under the penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
•	Your name, physical address and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of an Egyptian Court for the judicial district in which your physical address is located, or if your physical address is outside of the Egypt, for any judicial district in which we may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of allegedly infringing material or an agent of such person.
